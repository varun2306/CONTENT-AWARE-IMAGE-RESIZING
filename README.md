# CONTENT-AWARE-IMAGE-RESIZING
This project focuses on Content-Aware Image Resizing, a smart image scaling technique that resizes images while preserving important content and minimizing distortion. It uses seam carving to intelligently remove or insert pixels along paths of least importance, ensuring key elements in the image remain intact.
